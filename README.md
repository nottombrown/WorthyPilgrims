# Worthy Pilgrims

Let's start our pilgrimage. Add yourself to the members section. Under your name, put your experience and what you hope to get out of this. Then make a soundcloud playlist with five tracks that you would like to sound like.

Before the end of the year, we want to get each of us to one of our destinations.

I've spent ~ 80 hours messing with Ableton Push and a bunch of time on Hooktheory. I can play basic melodies and chords on the Push synth pads.

# Spirit Guides

- [Hooktheory Ear Training](http://www.hooktheory.com/ear-training) - Make an account and practice every day
- [Hooktheory Book](http://www.hooktheory.com/book1/app#/read/1/1) - Log in with nottombrown/worthypilgrims and read the first few chapters. Pay them money if you like it.
- [Smule Sing iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sing!-karaoke-by-smule/id509993510?mt=8) - Practice every day. Your voice will always be your most intuitive instrument. People connect more to vocals than any other portion of music.
- Songwriting Coursera Course
- [Sonic Academy](http://www.sonicacademy.com/) - This is the main thing we'll use for learning our tools

# Tools

- Ableton - This seems like the most popular software and we already have experience with it
- Ableton Push - Makes Ableton feel like an instrument
- Figure (iOS) - Try it for making weird little riffs on the go
- Samplr (iOS) - Chops up vocals beautifully, someone should get good with it
