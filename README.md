# Worthy Pilgrims

Let's start our pilgrimage. Add yourself to the members section. Under your name, put your experience and what you hope to get out of this. Then make a soundcloud playlist with five tracks that you would like to sound like.

Before the end of the year, we want to get each of us to one of our destinations.

# Spirit Guides

- [Hooktheory Ear Training](http://www.hooktheory.com/ear-training) - Make an account and practice every day
- [Hooktheory Book](http://www.hooktheory.com/book1/app#/read/1/1) - Log in with nottombrown/worthypilgrims and read the first few chapters. Pay them money if you like it.
- [Smule Sing iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sing!-karaoke-by-smule/id509993510?mt=8) - Practice every day. Your voice will always be your most intuitive instrument. People connect more to vocals than any other portion of music.
- Songwriting Coursera Course
- [Sonic Academy](http://www.sonicacademy.com/) - This is the main thing we'll use for learning our tools

# Tools

- Ableton - This seems like the most popular software and we already have experience with it
- Ableton Push - Makes Ableton feel like an instrument
- Figure (iOS) - Try it for making weird little riffs on the go
- Samplr (iOS) - Chops up vocals beautifully, someone should get good with it
- Splice - GitHub for Ableton allows you to sync project changes with multiple collaborators and peak inside other people's workflows
